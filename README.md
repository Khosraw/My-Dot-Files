**Warning**: If you don't know how any of the configuration works, don't use it. Use at your own risk!

Configurations were built off of the BSPWM configuration that came with Archcraft (October 2021 Update). For that reason this repository has a GNU license.

## Packages Needed/You should probably get...

**Bugs:** 
- Polybar will be underneath GLava unless you first open a terminal to `xdo raise` Polybar.
- The Polybar tray will always remain underneath GLava so you cannot interact with it. I can't seem to figure out a way to raise it over GLava.
