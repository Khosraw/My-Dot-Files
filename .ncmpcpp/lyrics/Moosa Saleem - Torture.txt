The inside of my skin is sore
I can feel them burrowing
Little scratches under every pore
How the hell did they get in

But I′m sure there is nothing there
I took a slice and peeked and looked and stared
But it's just all some empty skin
Sat in the red, poolin′

Stick my fingers in my ears
But you're still so crystal clear
The second hand it scratches me
That never leaves
I feel you breathe
It's torture
It′s torture
It′s torture

Try to run but it just follows
I'm locked away without a key
Wish I could get this over with
But it was never up to me

Stick my fingers in my ears
But you′re still so crystal clear
The second hand it scratches me
That never leaves
I feel you breathe
It's torture
(Torture)
It′s torture
It's torture
(Torture)
It′s torture
Ooooh, oh, ooh
It's torture
