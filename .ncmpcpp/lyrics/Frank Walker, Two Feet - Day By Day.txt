I'm feeling that it's over
You never seem to touch me the same way
Your stare has gotten colder
And your eyes are slowly fading day by day

And your eyes are slowly fading day by day
And your eyes are slowly fading day by day
And your eyes are slowly fading day by day

You said that our love didn't feel right
Put all the blame on my shoulders, babe
I could've tried a bit harder
A bit harder, girl, I know

I'm feeling that it's over
You never seem to touch me the same way
Your stare has gotten colder
And your eyes are slowly fading day by day

And your eyes are slowly fading day by day
And your eyes are slowly fading day by day
And your eyes are slowly fading day by day
