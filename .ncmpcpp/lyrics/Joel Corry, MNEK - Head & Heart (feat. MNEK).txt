Ba-ba-ba-dum ba-ba-dum ba-ba-dum
Ba-ba-ba-dum ba-ba-dum ba-ba-da-dum

Oh my God, oh my God
This feeling's just begun
I'm saying things I've never said
Doing things I've never done

Oh my God, oh my God
When I see you I should run
But I'm frozen in motion
And my head tells me to stop
Tells me to stop

Feeling feelings I feel about us
Try to fight it but it's never enough

My heart is certain
It's more than a crush
'Cause I'm frozen in motion
And my head tells me to stop

But my heart goes
Ba-ba-ba-dum ba-ba-dum ba-ba-dum
Ba-ba-ba-dum ba-ba-dum ba-ba-da-dum
'Cause my heart goes
Ba-ba-ba-dum ba-ba-dum ba-ba-dum
Ba-ba-ba-dum ba-ba-dum ba-ba-da-dum

Oh my God, oh my God
Can't believe what I've become
I'm thinking things I shouldn't think
Singing songs I've never sung

Oh my God, oh my God
When I see you I should run
But I'm frozen in motion
And my head tells me to stop
Tells me to stop

Feeling feelings I feel about us
Try to fight it but it's never enough
('Cause my heart)
My heart is certain
It's more than a crush
'Cause I'm frozen in motion
And my head tells me to stop

But my heart goes
Ba-ba-ba-dum ba-ba-dum ba-ba-dum
Ba-ba-ba-dum ba-ba-dum ba-ba-da-dum
'Cause my heart goes
Ba-ba-ba-dum ba-ba-dum ba-ba-dum
Ba-ba-ba-dum ba-ba-dum ba-ba-da-dum

But my heart goes
Ba-ba-ba-dum ba-ba-dum ba-ba-dum
Ba-ba-ba-dum ba-ba-dum ba-ba-da-dum
'Cause my heart goes
Ba-ba-ba-dum ba-ba-dum ba-ba-dum
Ba-ba-ba-dum ba-ba-dum ba-ba-da-dum

My head and my heart
My head and my heart
I can't tell them apart
My head tells me to run
But I can't

'Cause my heart goes
Ba-ba-ba-dum ba-ba-dum ba-ba-dum
Ba-ba-ba-dum ba-ba-dum ba-ba-da-dum
'Cause my heart goes
Ba-ba-ba-dum ba-ba-dum ba-ba-dum
Ba-ba-ba-dum ba-ba-dum ba-ba-da-dum

Oh my God, oh my God
This feeling's just begun
I'm saying things I've never said
Doing things I've never done

Oh my God, oh my God
When I see you I should run
But I'm frozen in motion
And my head tells me to stop

But my heart goes
